Introduction
------------

A multi-user multi-room ratchet server.

Requirements
------------

This library package requires PHP 5.4 or later.

Installation
------------

### Installing via Composer

The recommended way to install php-chat is through
[Composer](http://getcomposer.org).

```bash
# Install Composer
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
```

Next, run the Composer command to install the latest version of php-chat:

```bash
composer.phar require pmill/php-chat
```

After installing, you need to require Composer's autoloader:

```php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
```

Usage
-----

An example is provided in the example/ directory. Start the server with the command:

    php example/server.php

An barebones example HTML client interface is located at example/client.html. You will need to update the chatUrl variable in 
example/chat.js with the host name (or ip address) of the server you ran the previous command on.
 
    var chatUrl = 'ws://your-host-name:9911';
    
A prettier React and Semantic UI client interface is located at [pmill/react-chat](https://github.com/pmill/react-chat).
